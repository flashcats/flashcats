Not being able to re-arrange states has been a point of frustration for many users.

Fortunately, the first state you create in an application doesn't have to be your default.

You can right click on any state in the states panel to "set as default state".

This will be the initial state of your application.

Default state is identified at a quick glance by the tiny circular notch in the top, right hand colored corner section of each state.
