It is often desirable to change the appearance on rollover or mouse over of the cursor to indicate to the user that you can interact with an interactive object.

Flash Catalyst exposes an option to 'show hand cursor' when mousing over interactive objects (components).

<div>
  <!--more-->
</div>

You can find the 'hand cursor' checkbox in the properties panel, under the 'appearance' tab, as seen below:

<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Picture-6.png" rel="lightbox[21]"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-22" title="showHandCursor" src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Picture-6-221x300.png" alt="Show Hand Cursor" width="221" height="300" /></a>Again, note that this only appears for components.

If you'd like to show the hand cursor when mousing over graphic objects:

1) Select the graphics of interest  
2) Convert to custom component  
3) In appearance tab of properties panel, check 'hand cursor'
