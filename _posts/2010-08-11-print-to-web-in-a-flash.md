Hey all - more great stuff coming out of the design community:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DesignArmy_smaller.jpg" rel="lightbox[402]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DesignArmy_smaller-300x211.jpg" alt="" title="DesignArmy_smaller" width="300" height="211" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-403" /></a>  
Adobe and HOW magazine challenged some of our favorite designers to transform their existing print work into immersive, interactive projects for the web using Flash Catalyst CS5, and the results are stunning. The designers’ original print work can be seen in HOW’s September/October issue that’s just now hitting the stands, and the interactive results, along with commentary from the designers, can be seen at <http://bit.ly/cnUPhV>.
