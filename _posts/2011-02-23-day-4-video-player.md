I know it's been a while, but I'm going to stick with this days theme until we're up to 12. Here is a skinnable video player. It currently has a very small video, just to keep bandwidth down.

[kml_flashembed publishmethod="dynamic" fversion="10.0.0" movie="/static/skinnable-video-player/Main.swf" width="200" height="200" targetclass="flashmovie" base="/static/skinnable-video-player"]

[![Get Adobe Flash player][1]][2]

[/kml_flashembed]

It has 3 states, one for loading, one for when the video is paused, and one for when it is playing. It has a control-less video part, a horizontal slider seekbar, a horizontal slider volume bar, and play and pause buttons.

You can download the FXP [here][3].
