Also known as, the Dress-up Robot!

This skinnable component has a "droppables" group of graphics you can drag to and position on a "canvas" group. For this example, the droppables is a set of accessories for the robot in the canvas.

Click on the image to preview.

The fxp is available [here][2].

Details after the jump.

<!--more-->As always, this requires the Panini Preview or later to run.

The skin parts:

  * Droppables Group: A group of optimized graphics, each optimized graphic in the group will be droppable onto the canvas. Some optimized graphics may cause trouble when you drag an object over them. If this is the case, just rasterize the graphic, and then convert the image back to an optimized graphic.
  * Canvas Group: The group you can drop and position your droppables on. This object needs a background fill to properly pick up the mouse drops. In this case there's a white semi-opaque rectangle.
  * Trash Group: Dragging a droppable from the canvas to the trash group will remove it from the canvas.
  * Reset Button: Removes all droppables from the canvas. In this example, the reset button and trash group are one and the same.

Most of the graphics here are courtesy of [OpenClipArt][3], with the background generated by [BGPatterns][4]. For all you ever wanted to know about Drag & Drop in Flex, here is the [Flex After Dark tutorial][5].
