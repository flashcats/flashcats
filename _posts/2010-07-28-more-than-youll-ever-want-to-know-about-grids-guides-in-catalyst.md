You want grids and guides in Catalyst?

Well, we've got them.

This post is a simple rundown with some grids/guides tips and tricks... I mean, I need a break after that optimization post... right? <img src='http://localhost:8888/flashcats_wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />

**Creating Guides in Catalyst**  
It's easy. See those rulers along the top and bottom left sides of the artboard? 

To create a horizontal guide you simply have to click the top ruler, and drag downwards.

The horizontal guide appears, and you can place it wherever you'd like.

To create a vertical guide you simply have to click the left ruler, and drag towards the right.

The vertical guide appears, and you can place it wherever you'd like.

Easy so far... right? Here's a quite visual to keep you in line:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gridsGuides1.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/gridsGuides1-300x193.png" alt="" title="gridsGuides" width="300" height="193" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-353" /></a>

The default guide color in Catalyst is a bright green color (neon-ish). Don't worry, we can customize this.

**Customize the Color of Guides**  
So you're not a big fan of neon green?

No problem, Catalyst allows you to change the color of your guides.

In the top level View menu, you'll find an option for 'Grids and Guides Settings...'.  
Let's select that and tweak some settings.  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-24.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-24-300x123.png" alt="" title="GridsGuidesSettings" width="300" height="123" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-354" /></a>  
The neon green will stand out to you right away. Just click the green color slate to expose a color palette.  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-26.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-26-244x300.png" alt="" title="gridGuideSettings" width="244" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-356" /></a>  
Choose a different color, and press OK to dismiss the dialog.

Now, try dragging out some new guides.

Voila. I chose blue for mine.  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-27.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-27-300x240.png" alt="" title="blueGuides" width="300" height="240" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-357" /></a>

**Change the Style and Opacity of your Guides**  
Not only can you change the color of your guides, but you can also alter the style and opacity (gasp!).

First, let's change the style. Catalyst only offers one additional style type today... but what more do you need?  
We can have Solid lines, or Dotted lines.

Let's go back to our Grid & Guide Settings... dialog (see above if you skipped over setting the color).

Select 'Dotted' from the 'Style' dropdown control.  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-28.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-28-243x300.png" alt="" title="dottedGuidesStyle" width="243" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-360" /></a>  
Press OK, and observe (or drag out some new guides if you have run out!).

Next let's change the opacity. Since guides sit on top of all of your artboard content, it's often desirable to reduce their dominance when working on a project.

Use the slider control to configure your desired opacity setting. I chose 50%.  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-29.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-29-244x300.png" alt="" title="guidesOpacity" width="244" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-361" /></a>

Here's how my blue, dotted, 50% opacity guides look:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-30.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-30-300x278.png" alt="" title="styledGuides" width="300" height="278" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-363" /></a>

**How to Lock Guides**  
Once you've set up your guides for a Catalyst project, I feel it's extremely important to lock them.

There's nothing worse than trying to select an object on the artboard and hitting a guide and moving it by mistake... you've spent so much time setting them up and aligning your layout... why not keep it that way!

Let's go back to the Grid & Guide Settings dialog (see above if you're skipped down).

You'll notice a checkbox on the right hand side called 'Lock'.

<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-31.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-31.png" alt="" title="lockGuides" width="292" height="127" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364" /></a>

Just click it to select it, and voila! Locked guides.

**All about Grids**

**How to get grids to show up?**  
Lets navigate back to our Grids & Guides Settings dialog (Menu bar -> View -> Grids & Guide Settings...).

Now we're going to investigate the properties under the Grid section.

You'll find a 'Show' checkbox on the right hand side. 

<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-32.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-32-243x300.png" alt="" title="guideSettings" width="243" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-368" /></a>

Lets check it and press okay and return to our document.

You'll now see the artboard is divided evenly with gray grid lines, as shown below:

<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-33.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-33-300x226.png" alt="" title="defaultGridSettings" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-369" /></a>

**How to get objects to snap to the grid?**  
Lets go back to the Grid & Guide Settings dialog (see previous section to find out where it is).

You'll notice the dialog has an option under 'Grid' called snap. Make sure this checkbox is selected if you'd like to enable snapping to the grid.

Your settings should now look as follows:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-34.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-34-243x300.png" alt="" title="gridSnapSettings" width="243" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-370" /></a>

Press OK to dismiss the dialog and try dragging around a rectangle on the artboard.

You'll notice it will nicely snap to both the horizontal and vertical grid lines.

**Changing the Color of your Grid, changing line style, and changing opacity**

Follow each relevant section as found above for guides. You'll find it to be the exact same steps, except change each property under the 'Grid' section in the dialog.

I applied a purple colored grid, 80% opacity, and solid lines, check it out:

<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-36.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-36-243x300.png" alt="" title="customGridSettings" width="243" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-371" /></a>

And here's the outcome:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-38.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-38-300x228.png" alt="" title="customGridPurple" width="300" height="228" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-374" /></a>

**Varying the grid**  
The default grid in Catalyst comes standard with horizontal and vertical width/height dimensions of 20x20px.

You can adjust the width/height spacing dimensions in the Grid & Guides Settings dialog in the View menu.

I won't get into the whys and whens of using custom grids, but I will point you at an interesting article by **[Smashing Magazine][1]** on '[Designing with Grid Based Approach][2]'.

As an example, I set the width/height to be 40px and 60px respectively in the settings dialog, as follows:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-2.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-2-243x300.png" alt="" title="gridSettingsWidthHeight" width="243" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-379" /></a>

Here's the outcome on the Catalyst artboard:  
<a href="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-3.png" rel="lightbox[355]"><img src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Picture-3-300x228.png" alt="" title="customGridSettings" width="300" height="228" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-380" /></a>
