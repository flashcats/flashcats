Here is a skinnable popup component, a little button that displays some popup content. In this case, I've decided to play graphic designer.

[kml_flashembed publishmethod="dynamic" fversion="10.1.0" movie="/static/skinnable-popup-component/Main.swf" width="100%" height="300" targetclass="flashmovie"]

[![Get Adobe Flash player][1]][2]

[/kml_flashembed]

The popup is displayed on top of the rest of the application. Since it is modal, the rest of the application is grayed out while the popup is open.

You can download the fxp [here][3].
