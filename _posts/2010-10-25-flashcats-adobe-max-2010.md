Hey all MAX attendees!  
Bear and I are at Adobe MAX 2010 in LA this week.

We'd love for any Flash Catalyst user MAX attendees to come to the Flash Catalyst Meet the Team event tonight at 9pm if you're at the conference.

If you can't make the Meet the Team session, but are at the conference, please post a comment here and we'll followup to make sure we can meet you in person while we're here for lunch!  
Lots of new posts on Adobe Flash Catalyst Panini in the weeks to come - look out for them <img src='http://localhost:8888/flashcats_wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
