I mocked up a quick Flex Lightbox component, which I have lovingly dubbed "FlightBox." Click on the image below to hop to the actual swf.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-514" title="flightbox-preview" src="http://flashcats.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/flightbox-preview.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="306" />][1]

Take an image list and wrap it inside the FlightBox skin. You must also include a skin part, the "chrome," that surrounds the popped up image. In this case, the chrome looks like a polaroid photo. The tiled background is courtesy of [squidfingers][2].
