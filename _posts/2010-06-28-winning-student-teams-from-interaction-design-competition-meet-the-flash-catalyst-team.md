On May 6, 2010, [Adobe][1], [Hearst Corporation's][2] innovation group, and the [Reynolds Journalism Institute][3] (RJI) at the Missouri School of Journalism announced the two winning teams in a student interaction design competition to produce interactive applications that solve real-world needs in the advertising or news-gathering sides of the journalism industry. On May 11, the winning teams from RJI, as well as the winning student team from [Fudan University][4] in Shanghai, working on a parallel project for Shanghai World Expo, came to Adobe San Francisco to present their projects and meet the team behind [Adobe Flash Catalyst CS5][5] , the software at the center of their projects. 

Check out this [video][6] on the studentsâ€™ experience with Flash Catalyst and meeting the Adobe Flash Catalyst team.
